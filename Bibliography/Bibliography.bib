	abstract = {In order to create a sustainable future for the urban environment in s=Smart cities, it is necessary to develop a concept of urban transport, partially reduce the use of traditional transport, primarily cars, as well as the environmental pressure on society, which is essential to move to a sustainable urban future. In the latest discussions on the future of the urban transport system, the quality of the environment, and the possibility of its improvement are discussed, this issue became especially relevant with the onset of the pandemic, when the lockdowns were introduced. The problem of sustainable transport in urban areas has been recognized in academic studies, searching for appropriate models and solutions. The article presents the latest literature review and illustrates the newest trends with several examples. VOS Viewer software has been used to classify the different keywords, according to their co-citation, following clustering techniques. By analyzing the research conducted by other researchers, it has been possible to structure the ecosystem and trends in the Urban Transportation Concept, also mentioning likely future trends. Based on the literature analysis of the Sustainable Urban Transport, the authors of the study found that a large group of researchers deal with technical solutions and innovative business models, while the essential behavioral aspects are examined in less detail. Extensive literature analysis allowed the authors to select several solutions to achieve the transformation towards sustainable transportation in urban areas: new vehicle technologies and their environmental factors’ analysis, geographic information systems, the analytic hierarchy process method, the time series analysis of road traffic accidents using multiplicative models, electrification and use of Friedman Analysis of Variance by Ranks, as well as innovations in sharing mobility.},

Public transport can be more attractive by providing "Door to door mobility" and development of transportation services is an important factor of social quality. Public transport accessibility has gained vital importance in designing and evaluating the transit system in terms of mobility and sustainability. Apart from the transport system itself, public transport accessibility has the considerable impact on life satisfaction in the form of perceived accessibility. Moreover, researchers have revealed several impact and correlation of provision of public transport accessibility to the environment and daily life which would have a noticeable impact on public health and other aspects of public daily life. Furthermore, the correlation between public transport accessibility and job opportunities has attracted the researchers' attention in the literature. Also, public participation in social activities has been investigated based on public transport accessibility and their close connection has been revealed under the topic of social exclusion. In this paper, the available literature on public transport accessibility has been reviewed. As a conclusion, it should be highlighted that not just the performance of public transportation but its impact on other social aspects should be considered while planning the public transport facilities.},

	abstract = {Sustainable mobility and transport are topics that have been rising exponentially since the 2000s within the academic community and society. One of the main drivers for this is the intensification of the urbanization processes on a global scale, which leads to higher demand for services and transport systems, consequently bringing more severe concern regarding social, environmental, and economic issues. However, nations do not seem to advance at the same pace regarding the proposition of policies and the implementation of strategies to promote sustainable mobility and transport. Latin American countries have long been striving to improve and implement, on a larger scale, mobility solutions toward more sustainable human agglomerations. Therefore, this article analyzes the sustainable mobility challenges in the Latin American context through a systematic literature review process. The main results show that within the Latin American context, there is a significant focus on the social inequality of mobility in urban areas, which is developed in studies through mobility indicators and modeling, participatory and other qualitative approaches, and a critical analysis of public policies. However, there is a need to explore, through alternative methodologies, such as experimental and in-situ evaluations, the paths/routes of trips within the Latin American context at different scales to promote a better understanding and strategies to advance towards more sustainable cities and mobilities and deliver a better mobility experience for citizens, adding value to the mobility itself.},

This research leverages highly disaggregated crowdsourced data from Latin America to study the effect of road congestion on levels of carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter in four of the most congested cities in developing countries: Bogota, Buenos Aires, Mexico City, and Santiago. Based on a panel data econometric approach with over 4.4 billion records from Waze and hourly data from 54 air monitoring stations for 2019, our two-stage least square model shows a cumulative increase of 0.6\% in response to a 1\% of road congestion on the three air pollutants. Moreover, we find a nonlinear relationship between road congestion and air quality and estimate the threshold above which the effect decays. This study provides evidence that supports public policies designed to make urban mobility more sustainable by implementing measures to reduce road congestion in developing contexts.},

	abstract = {Curb space is one of the busiest areas in urban road networks. Especially in recent years, the rapid increase of ride-hailing trips and commercial deliveries has induced massive pick-ups/drop-offs (PUDOs), which occupy the limited curb space that was designed and built decades ago. These PUDOs could jam curbside utilization and disturb the mainline traffic flow, evidently leading to significant negative societal externalities. However, there is a lack of an analytical framework that rigorously quantifies and mitigates the congestion effect of PUDOs in the system view, particularly with little data support and involvement of confounding effects. To bridge this research gap, this paper develops a rigorous causal inference approach to estimate the congestion effect of PUDOs on general regional networks. A causal graph is set to represent the spatio-temporal relationship between PUDOs and traffic speed, and a double and separated machine learning (DSML) method is proposed to quantify how PUDOs affect traffic congestion. Additionally, a re-routing formulation is developed and solved to encourage passenger walking and traffic flow re-routing to achieve system optimization. Numerical experiments are conducted using real-world data in the Manhattan area. On average, 100 additional units of PUDOs in a region could reduce the traffic speed by 3.70 and 4.54 mph on weekdays and weekends, respectively. Re-routing trips with PUDOs on curb space could respectively reduce the system-wide total travel time by 2.44\% and 2.12\% in Midtown and Central Park on weekdays. Sensitivity analysis is also conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework.},

Regarding the methodology, a mixed approach complemented by a descriptive non-experimental and cross-sectional scope has been chosen. A convenience sample of sixty-three students was selected, to whom an anonymous survey was administered as a data collection instrument. The results indicate that students are highly exposed to vehicular traffic congestion due to daily attendance at the university and the use of automobiles and public transportation. On the other hand, it was identified that vehicular traffic congestion moderately affects students' academic performance. Finally, based on student perception, it is concluded that greater investment in road infrastructure and improvement of the public transportation system are key factors for improving urban travel, not only in the city of Asunción, but also in other cities in the country.},

	abstract = {Traffic congestion is one of the major barriers to the economic development of developing economies, resulting in severe social and economic impacts. The severity of traffic congestion in port and industrial areas is more thought-provoking than destructive barriers. The purpose of this research is to better understand the social, economic, and environmental effects of road traffic congestion in a developing city's port and industrial areas. This study adopted an on-site survey strategy to collect data from regular road-users by administering questionnaires, performing volume count surveys, and measuring travel time, delay time, and vehicle speed throughout the day. Along with documenting numerous social impacts, this assessment also assessed the impacts on stress through a four-point Likert-type scale. The congestion level in the four divided road sections was identified using the Level of Service index and based on respondents’ opinions. The delayed costs, fuel loss costs, pollution costs, and loss of vehicle operators due to traffic congestion have been estimated. The study found that excessive vehicles, narrow roads, ineffective public transport modes, and bus operators’ attitudes are causing congestion, resulting in high to extreme stress levels for road users, with a total economic loss of \$2.01 million per day. The overall stress score of 3.23 ± 0.71 indicates the impact of traffic congestion on the respondents was high to an extreme level and had significant social impacts on different sociodemographic groups. This study can guide future work regarding sustainable transportation systems in emerging cities as well as traffic planning and policy adaptation for sustainable transportation systems, focusing on the reduction of adverse socioeconomic impacts.},

Micromobility (e.g., shared bikes) represents a significant opportunity to replace short private vehicles trips (0–3 miles) and reduce transportation sector emissions. This paper uses Seattle as a case study and estimates that up to 18\% of short car trips could be replaced by micromobility. A static traffic assignment model is developed to simulate and compare the results of peak hour traffic under a base case scenario (2014 traffic conditions) to scenarios where a portion of short car trips are substituted by micromobility. Results indicate that micromobility could reduce congestion on heavily congested corridors and wide-scale bike lane deployment can maximize congestion benefits, but the impacts to energy use and emissions are disproportionately low and other measures (e.g., vehicle electrification) are needed to meet climate change emissions targets.},

	abstract = {Transportation has been a key element to global economic success since the days of the Egyptian pharaohs, the Chinese dynasties, and the Roman legions. In the beginning, land and water vias were the dominant transportation paradigms. With the industrial revolution came improvements in road construction, the railroad and the airplane. The ability of the latter two to move vast amounts of goods and people in a short period of time have made them the preferred long distance haul paradigms. Today, in the information age, the quest is for global economic efficiency in a world economy governed by environmental concerns, economic alliances, and trade agreements. This paper discusses some of the socio-economic factors driving the various on-going, national transportation programs. The U.S. program is used, as an example, to establish the technical and social thrusts being addressed by these programs. Each thrust is described in sufficient detail to give the reader a feel for the objectives that have been set, the accomplishments made, and the challenges that lay ahead. The evolution of intelligent transportation programs in the U.S., Japan, and Europe is also discussed.},

	abstract = {We live in the era of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), which is an extension of Vehicular AdHoc Networks (VANETs). In VANETs, vehicles act as nodes connected with each other and sometimes with a public station. Vehicles continuously exchange and collect information to provide innovative transportation services; for example, traffic management, navigation, autonomous driving, and the generation of alerts. However, VANETs are extremely challenging for data collection, due to their high mobility and dynamic network topologies that cause frequent link disruptions and make path discovery difficult. In this survey, various state-of-the-art data collection protocols for VANETs are discussed, based on three broad categories, i.e., delay-tolerant, best-effort, and real-time protocols. A taxonomy is designed for data collection protocols for VANETs that is essential to add precision and ease of understandability. A detailed comparative analysis among various data collection protocols is provided to highlight their functionalities and features. Protocols are evaluated based on three parametric phases. First, protocols investigation based on six necessary parameters, including delivery and drop ratio, efficiency, and recovery strategy. Second, a 4-D functional framework is designed to fit most data collection protocols for quick classification and mobility model identification, thus eradicating the need to read extensive literature. In the last, in-depth categorical mapping is performed to deep dive for better and targeted interpretation. In addition, some open research challenges for ITS and VANETs are discussed to highlight research gaps. Our work can thus be employed as a quick guide for researchers to identify the technical relevance of data collection protocols of VANETs.},

	abstract = {The acceleration of urbanization has led to increasingly severe traffic congestion, creating an urgent need for effective traffic signal control strategies to improve road efficiency. This paper proposes an adaptive traffic signal control method based on offline reinforcement learning (Offline RL) to address the limitations of traditional fixed-time signal control methods. By monitoring key parameters such as real-time traffic flow and queue length, the proposed method dynamically adjusts signal phases and durations in response to rapidly changing traffic conditions. At the core of this research is the design of a model named SD3-Light, which leverages advanced offline reinforcement learning to predict the optimal signal phase sequences and their durations based on real-time intersection state features. Additionally, this paper constructs a comprehensive offline dataset, which enables the model to be trained without relying on real-time traffic data, thereby reducing costs and improving the model’s generalization ability. Experiments conducted on real-world traffic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in reducing the average travel time. Comparisons with several existing methods highlight the clear advantages of our approach in enhancing traffic management efficiency.},

Mobile optical receivers gather data, determine their location, and read transmitted information through joint transmission. An intersection manager coordinates traffic and communicates with vehicles through embedded Driver Agents. The system utilizes a "mesh/cellular" hybrid network configuration and encodes data into light signals emitted by transmitters. Optical sensors and filtering properties enable reception and decoding. The study demonstrates bidirectional communication, employing queue/request/response mechanisms and relative pose concepts for safe vehicle passage.

	abstract = {Vehicular traffic is endlessly increasing everywhere in the world and can cause terrible traffic congestion at intersections. Most of the traffic lights today feature a fixed green light sequence, therefore the green light sequence is determined without taking the presence of the emergency vehicles into account. Therefore, emergency vehicles such as ambulances, police cars, fire engines, etc. stuck in a traffic jam and delayed in reaching their destination can lead to loss of property and valuable lives. This paper presents an approach to schedule emergency vehicles in traffic. The approach combines the measurement of the distance between the emergency vehicle and an intersection using visual sensing methods, vehicle counting and time sensitive alert transmission within the sensor network. The distance between the emergency vehicle and the intersection is calculated for comparison using Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance and Canberra distance techniques. The experimental results have shown that the Euclidean distance outperforms other distance measurement techniques. Along with visual sensing techniques to collect emergency vehicle information, it is very important to have a Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol to deliver the emergency vehicle information to the Traffic Management Center (TMC) with less delay. Then only the emergency vehicle is quickly served and can reach the destination in time. In this paper, we have also investigated the MAC layer in WSNs to prioritize the emergency vehicle data and to reduce the transmission delay for emergency messages. We have modified the medium access procedure used in standard IEEE 802.11p with PE-MAC protocol, which is a new back off selection and contention window adjustment scheme to achieve low broadcast delay for emergency messages. A VANET model for the UTMS is developed and simulated in NS-2. The performance of the standard IEEE 802.11p and the proposed PE-MAC is analysed in detail. The NS-2 simulation results have shown that the PE-MAC outperforms the IEEE 802.11p in terms of average end-to-end delay, throughput and energy consumption. The performance evaluation results have proven that the proposed PE-MAC prioritizes the emergency vehicle data and delivers the emergency messages to the TMC with less delay compared to the IEEE 802.11p. The transmission delay of the proposed PE-MAC is also compared with the standard IEEE 802.15.4, and Enhanced Back-off Selection scheme for IEEE 802.15.4 protocol [EBSS, an existing protocol to ensure fast transmission of the detected events on the road towards the TMC] and the comparative results have proven the effectiveness of the PE-MAC over them. Furthermore, this research work will provide an insight into the design of an intelligent urban traffic management system for the effective management of emergency vehicles and will help to save lives and property.},

	abstract = {Sub-optimal control policies in transportation systems negatively impact mobility, the environment and human health. Developing optimal transportation control systems at the appropriate scale can be difficult as cities' transportation systems can be large, complex and stochastic. Intersection traffic signal controllers are an important element of modern transportation infrastructure where sub-optimal control policies can incur high costs to many users. Many adaptive traffic signal controllers have been proposed by the community but research is lacking regarding their relative performance difference - which adaptive traffic signal controller is best remains an open question. This research contributes a framework for developing and evaluating different adaptive traffic signal controller models in simulation - both learning and non-learning - and demonstrates its capabilities. The framework is used to first, investigate the performance variance of the modelled adaptive traffic signal controllers with respect to their hyperparameters and second, analyze the performance differences between controllers with optimal hyperparameters. The proposed framework contains implementations of some of the most popular adaptive traffic signal controllers from the literature; Webster's, Max-pressure and Self-Organizing Traffic Lights, along with deep Q-network and deep deterministic policy gradient reinforcement learning controllers. This framework will aid researchers by accelerating their work from a common starting point, allowing them to generate results faster with less effort.

	abstract = {Traffic light control systems are widely used to monitor and control vehicles’ flow to provide a smooth and orderly flow of traffic by controlling which lane should be granted to pass through the intersection point without compromising on safety standards. However, a conventional traffic light system handles neither dynamic traffic flow nor the prioritization of emergency vehicles (EVs). Consequently leads to congestion as the conventional traffic light grants underutilized road lanes to have the equal cycle length as a congested lane and possibly causes an accident and delay when multiple EVs are approaching the intersection. This paper proposes an intelligent system that dynamically adjusts the cycle length for each of the lanes at an intersection based on the vehicular density and grants the different types of EVs to pass through the intersection point by assigning different priorities. The system consists of three modules, the traffic light control module, the emergency Radio-frequency identification (RFID) moduleandtheinternetmodule.

	abstract = {The escalating complexity of modern transportation systems, fueled by rapid urbanization and the increasing integration of autonomous vehicles, requires a fundamental shift in traffic management strategies. Traditional traffic models struggle to adapt to the new challenges posed by higher vehicle densities and the diverse operational behaviors of both automated and non-automated vehicles. As a result, existing models often fail to accurately predict traffic flow and road safety in these dynamic environments, particularly due to the unpredictable interactions between different vehicle types.

 To address these challenges, digital twin technology offers a promising solution. By creating virtual representations of real-world traffic systems, digital twins enable the integration of real-time data from a network of smart sensors. This integration allows for the simulation of traffic flow under various conditions, incorporating factors such as vehicle volume, speed, and driver behavior. The ability to simulate a wide range of traffic scenarios in a controlled virtual environment facilitates the testing and validation of new traffic management strategies, which can lead to improved road safety outcomes and a more responsive approach to traffic control.

 In parallel, the adoption of open-source standards is crucial for the successful implementation of digital twin-based traffic management systems. Open-source software and data formats ensure interoperability, scalability, and collaboration across different platforms and stakeholders, accelerating innovation within the field. These standards help create a collaborative environment where researchers and developers can work together, fostering the continuous improvement and sustainability of traffic management systems. Moreover, the availability of open-source tools reduces entry barriers for researchers and practitioners, making it easier to implement and adopt these advanced technologies, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness of traffic management solutions. This paper explores how integrating smart sensors, open-source standards, and digital twin Platform can significantly enhance road safety.},

We have worked on this issue due to the increasing complexity of urban transportation systems, coupled with the urgent need to improve efficiency, safety, and sustainability in cities. The work presented in this paper is part of the project METACITIES, an Excellence Hub that spans a large geographical area, that of Southeastern Europe. The approach of the Greek innovation ecosystem of METACITIES involves leveraging digital twin technology to create intelligent replicas of urban mobility environments, enabling real-time monitoring, analysis, and decision making. Through use cases such as “Smart Parking”, “Environmental Behavior Analysis on Traffic Incidents”, and “Emergency Management”, we demonstrate how digital twins can optimize traffic flow, mitigate environmental impact, and enhance emergency response; these use cases will be tested on a small scale, before deciding on implementation at a larger and more expensive scale. The final outcome is the METACITIES Architecture for smart mobility, which will be part of an Open Digital Twin Framework capable of evolving a smart city into a metacity.},

	abstract = {Traffic lights have been used for decades to control and manage traffic flows crossing road intersections to increase traffic efficiency and road safety. However, relying on fixed time cycles may not be ideal in dealing with the increasing congestion level in cities. Therefore, we propose a new Adaptive Traffic Light Control System (ATLCS) to assist traffic management authorities in efficiently dealing with traffic congestion in cities. The main idea of our ATLCS consists in synchronizing a number of traffic lights controlling consecutive junctions by creating a delay between the times at which each of them switches to green in a given direction. Such a delay is dynamically updated based on the number of vehicles waiting at each junction, thereby allowing vehicles leaving the city centre to travel a long distance without stopping (i.e., minimizing the number of occurrences of the ‘stop and go’ phenomenon), which in turn reduces their travel time as well. The performance evaluation of our ATLCS has shown that the average travel time of vehicles traveling in the synchronized direction has been significantly reduced (by up to 39\%) compared to non-synchronized fixed time Traffic Light Control Systems. Moreover, the overall achieved improvement across the simulated road network was 17\%.},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence, Big Data and the Internet of Things ( IoT ) have been in constant development within various fields of study for their application, especially within Traffic Management Systems and sustainable urban transport, the above was born with the need to reduce, mitigate and control large traffic flows, polluting emissions from vehicles, long travel times and traffic accidents that occur within cities, especially cities in underdeveloped countries, such as the Latin American zone. It is important to generate development strategies that consider a multidimensional and long-term perspective, the success of urban development requires strategic governance and the construction of public projects and the construction of the habitat as a public matter with social inclusion. Coordinated action is needed for environmental protection, territorial planning and public policies. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to analyze the implementation of Artificial Intelligence, Big Data and IoT within Traffic Management systems, specifically, within the Ibero-American zone, likewise, to examine the most effective artificial intelligence technologies and algorithms such as Predictive Models that provide traffic flows helping to have better control within the roads, these use Neural Networks to improve the statistical models used in these models, Machine Learning and Deep Learning among others, which have shown to have positive results in predicting demand and reducing vehicular congestion and accidents within cities and identify the challenges and limitations found in the implementation of these solutions within cities. For the above, a bibliographic review and a bibliometric analysis were carried out, which was performed using the Scopus database, supported by Bibliometrix and VOSviewer for bibliometrics, analyzing information on data, trends and characteristics of research publication, most preferred and productive journals, author, journal and productive countries, thematic evaluation and co-occurrence of words. The results show a low relevance of Ibero-America within the field of study despite having several investigations developed within it. The knowledge obtained in this research will be valuable for young researchers, industry professionals, transport policy makers and government entities in their search to identify solutions to road congestion.},

	abstract = {The time has now come when graph theory should be part of the education of every serious student of mathematics and computer science, both for its own sake and to enhance the appreciation of mathematics as a whole. This book is an in-depth account of graph theory, written with such a student in mind; it reflects the current state of the subject and emphasizes connections with other branches of pure mathematics. The volume grew out of the author's earlier book, Graph Theory -- An Introductory Course, but its length is well over twice that of its predecessor, allowing it to reveal many exciting new developments in the subject. Recognizing that graph theory is one of several courses competing for the attention of a student, the book contains extensive descriptive passages designed to convey the flavor of the subject and to arouse interest. In addition to a modern treatment of the classical areas of graph theory such as coloring, matching, extremal theory, and algebraic graph theory, the book presents a detailed account of newer topics, including Szemer'edi's Regularity Lemma and its use, Shelah's extension of the Hales-Jewett Theorem, the precise nature of the phase transition in a random graph process, the connection between electrical networks and random walks on graphs, and the Tutte polynomial and its cousins in knot theory. In no other branch of mathematics is it as vital to tackle and solve challenging exercises in order to master the subject. To this end, the book contains an unusually large number of well thought-out exercises: over 600 in total. Although some are straightforward, most of them are substantial, and others will stretch even the most able reader.},

	abstract = {This research is focused on traffic congestion in the small island of Malta which is the most densely populated country in the EU with about 1,672 inhabitants per square kilometre (4,331 inhabitants/sq mi). Furthermore, Malta has a rapid vehicle growth. Based on our research, the number of vehicles increased by around 11,000 in a little more than 6 months, which shows how important it is to have an accurate and comprehensive means of collecting data to tackle the issue of fluctuating traffic in Malta. In this paper, we first present the newly built comprehensive traffic dataset, called MalTra. This dataset includes realistic trips made by members of the public across the island over a period of 200 days. We then describe the methodology we adopted to generate syntactic data to complete our data set as much as possible. In our research, we consider both MalTra and the Q-Traffic dataset, which has been used in several other research studies. The statistical ARIMA model and two graph neural networks, the spatial temporal graph convolutional network (STGCN) and the diffusion convolutional recurrent network (DCRNN) were used to analyse and compare the results with existing research. From the evaluation, we found that the DCRNN model outperforms the STGCN with the former resulting in MAE of 3.98 (6.65 in the case of the latter) and a RMSE of 7.78 (against 12.73 of the latter).},

Urban transport networks have recurring difficulties with congestion, safety, and traffic efficiency. Graph theory offers a methodical and practical solution to these issues. We examine the fundamental ideas of graph theory in further detail, including its applicability to transportation networks and the many kinds of graphs that are employed in traffic control, including their static and dynamic performance. The article shows how graphical algorithms may be used to improve traffic management, including the shortest path method, flow optimisation, and traffic light synchronisation. Furthermore, we show the usefulness of graph theory in smart city traffic light synchronisation, public transit routing, incident management, and ITS integration through case studies and real-world applications. Data collecting, scalability, and the influence of autonomous cars are just a few of the difficulties and future trends in this sector that are highlighted. In conclusion, this study emphasises the crucial part that graph theory plays in raising transportation efficiency and safety. Its incorporation into traffic control systems holds the possibility of creating more flexible and responsive transport networks, enhancing urban sustainability.},

Transportation and mobility networks, Internet, mobile phone networks, power grids, social and contact networks, neural networks, are all examples where space is relevant and where topology alone does not contain all the information. Characterizing and understanding the structure and the evolution of spatial networks is thus crucial for many different fields ranging from urbanism to epidemiology. An important consequence of space on networks is that there is a cost associated to the length of edges which in turn has dramatic effects on the topological structure of these networks. We will expose thoroughly the current state of our understanding of how the spatial constraints affect the structure and properties of these networks. We will review the most recent empirical observations and the most important models of spatial networks. We will also discuss various processes which take place on these spatial networks, such as phase transitions, random walks, synchronization, navigation, resilience, and disease spread.},

In this paper, the authors addresses a study of six cases of urban street networks characterised by different patterns and historical roots. The authors propose a representation of the street networks based firstly on a primal graph, where intersections are turned into nodes and streets into edges. In a second step, a dual graph, where streets are nodes and intersections are edges, is constructed by means of an innovative generalisation model named Intersection Continuity Negotiation, which allows to acknowledge the continuity of streets over a plurality of edges. Finally, the authors address a comparative study of some structural properties of the networks, seeking significant similarities among clusters of cases. A wide set of network analysis techniques are implemented over the dual graph: in particular the authors show that most of the considered networks have a broad degree distribution typical of scale-free networks and exhibit small-world properties as well.},

	abstract = {Recent theoretical and empirical studies have focused on the structural properties of complex relational networks in social, biological and technological systems. Here we study the basic properties of twenty 1-square-mile samples of street patterns of different world cities. Samples are represented by spatial (planar) graphs, i.e. valued graphs defined by metric rather than topologic distance and where street intersections are turned into nodes and streets into edges. We study the distribution of nodes in the 2-dimensional plane. We then evaluate the local properties of the graphs by measuring the meshedness coefficient and counting short cycles (of three, four and five edges), and the global properties by measuring global efficiency and cost. As normalization graphs, we consider both minimal spanning trees (MST) and greedy triangulations (GT) induced by the same spatial distribution of nodes. The results indicate that most of the cities have evolved into networks as efficienct as GT, although their cost is closer to the one of a tree. An analysis based on relative efficiency and cost is able to characterize different classes of cities.},

For road networks, we show that one can compute driving directions in milliseconds or less even at continental scale. A variety of techniques provide different trade-offs between preprocessing effort, space requirements, and query time. Some algorithms can answer queries in a fraction of a microsecond, while others can deal efficiently with real-time traffic. Journey planning on public transportation systems, although conceptually similar, is a significantly harder problem due to its inherent time-dependent and multicriteria nature. Although exact algorithms are fast enough for interactive queries on metropolitan transit systems, dealing with continent-sized instances requires simplifications or heavy preprocessing. The multimodal route planning problem, which seeks journeys combining schedule-based transportation (buses, trains) with unrestricted modes (walking, driving), is even harder, relying on approximate solutions even for metropolitan inputs.},

This is problematic for transportation in general; therefore, its design calls for optimization solutions to improve overall efficiency. In the process, this work discusses how to apply Dijkstra's Algorithm on the shortest path problem of the graph-based representation for modeling urban transportation. Dijkstra's algorithm finds an optimal path due to its weighted graph that represents road conditions and travel metrics. Experimental investigations underline its efficacy and shortcomings regarding dynamic urban contexts.

This paper applied the A* algorithm to QoS-aware routing and compared it with Bellman–Ford and Dijkstra in 5G/6G slicing, IoT multi-hop, and SDN/backbone settings. We introduced admissible, domain-specific heuristics that integrate graph distance with live network indicators (queueing delay, link loss, available bandwidth, residual energy). Across trace-driven and synthetic topologies, A* achieved lower end-to-end latency and jitter, faster convergence, and reduced routing overhead relative to the baselines, while maintaining competitive delivery ratio and energy per delivered bit. When admissibility held, A* preserved optimal paths with fewer expansions; with non-admissible but informative heuristics, it delivered favorable latency-overhead trade-offs. The results demonstrate that heuristic-guided routing can meet emerging QoS demands in real-time and resource-constrained networks, providing a scalable and implementation-ready alternative to traditional shortest-path methods.},

This enables us to make a systematic comparison between three different approaches to construct a graph representation of a transportation network; the resulting graphs are fundamentally different. We also find that the real-life traffic pattern is very heterogenous, both in space and traffic flow intensities.},

	abstract = {Based on fluid-dynamic and many-particle (car-following) simulations of traffic flows in (urban) networks, we study the problem of coordinating incompatible traffic flows at intersections. Inspired by the observation of self-organized oscillations of pedestrian flows at bottlenecks [D. Helbing and P. Molnár, Phys. Eev. E 51 (1995) 4282--4286], we propose a self-organization approach to traffic light control. The problem can be treated as multi-agent problem with interactions between vehicles and traffic lights. Specifically, our approach assumes a priority-based control of traffic lights by the vehicle flows themselves, taking into account short-sighted anticipation of vehicle flows and platoons. The considered local interactions lead to emergent coordination patterns such as ``green waves'' and achieve an efficient, decentralized traffic light control. While the proposed self-control adapts flexibly to local flow conditions and often leads to non-cyclical switching patterns with changing service sequences of different traffic flows, an almost periodic service may evolve under certain conditions and suggests the existence of a spontaneous synchronization of traffic lights despite the varying delays due to variable vehicle queues and travel times. The self-organized traffic light control is based on an optimization and a stabilization rule, each of which performs poorly at high utilizations of the road network, while their proper combination reaches a superior performance. The result is a considerable reduction not only in the average travel times, but also of their variation. Similar control approaches could be applied to the coordination of logistic and production processes.},

	abstract = {As part of its European strategy for Artificial Intelligence (AI), and as a response to the increasing ethical questions raised by this technology, the European Commission established an independent High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI HLEG) in June 2018. The group was tasked to draft two deliverables: AI Ethics Guidelines and Policy and Investment Recommendations. Nine months later, its first deliverable was published, putting forward a comprehensive framework to achieve “Trustworthy AI” by offering ethical guidance to AI practitioners. This paper dives into the work carried out by the group, focusing in particular on its AI Ethics Guidelines. First, this paper clarifies the context that led to the creation of the AI HLEG and its mandate (I). Subsequently, it elaborates on the Guidelines’ aim and purpose (II), and analyses the Guidelines’ drafting process (III). Particular focus is given to the questions surrounding the respective role played by ethics and law in the AI governance landscape (IV), as well as some of the challenges that had to be overcome throughout the process (V). Finally, this paper places the Guidelines in an international context, and sets out the next steps (VI) ahead on the journey towards an appropriate governance framework for AI (VII).},

As developed economies move to matured stages of the fourth industrial revolution, the quality of education needs to keep up with the required technological changes brought about by the digital transformation created by these technologies. However, studies on the impact of the digital transformation of the higher education system and its effect on sustainability are few. This study bridged this gap by providing empirical evidence on the subject matter through a synergy of extant studies. The methodology used herein involves a combination of a systematic literature review and a bibliometric analysis. The results of this study show that the digital transformation of the higher education sector is leading to the development of sustainable curriculums, digitalization of the higher education, enhancement of innovation, and an improvement in the performance of students. It also shows that the future of the digital transformation of the higher education sector will include—the advancement of the concept of ‘Education 4.0’, an increase in gamification within the sector, a rise in the use of datafication in decision making, and the integration of artificial intelligence/augmented intelligence to reform higher education.},

Para alcanzar este propósito, se implementó un enfoque metodológico mixto, que combinó la aplicación de encuestas a docentes y estudiantes, entrevistas semiestructuradas y la observación participante en clases híbridas. Los resultados evidencian que, si bien la adopción de modelos híbridos ha permitido una mayor flexibilidad y acceso a la educación, persisten retos significativos en cuanto a la adaptación pedagógica, el manejo de herramientas tecnológicas y la evaluación del aprendizaje. Asimismo, se identificó la necesidad de fortalecer la formación docente continua y el diseño de estrategias didácticas innovadoras que respondan a la diversidad de los estudiantes. El estudio concluye que la consolidación de la educación híbrida requiere una visión institucional integral, así como el compromiso de los actores educativos para superar las barreras identificadas y potenciar las oportunidades que ofrece este modelo. Además, se observó que la interacción entre estudiantes y docentes en entornos híbridos demanda nuevas competencias comunicativas y una gestión más efectiva del tiempo y los recursos digitales. La investigación subraya la importancia de fomentar espacios de colaboración y retroalimentación constante que permitan ajustar las prácticas pedagógicas en función de las necesidades emergentes.},

	abstract = {Abstract Understanding a complex system of relationships between courses is of great importance for the university’s educational mission. This paper is dedicated to the study of course-prerequisite networks ({CPNs}), where nodes represent courses and directed links represent the formal prerequisite relationships between them. The main goal of {CPNs} is to model interactions between courses, represent the flow of knowledge in academic curricula, and serve as a key tool for visualizing, analyzing, and optimizing complex curricula. First, we consider several classical centrality measures, discuss their meaning in the context of {CPNs}, and use them for the identification of important courses. Next, we describe the hierarchical structure of a {CPN} using the topological stratification of the network. Finally, we perform the interdependence analysis, which allows to quantify the strength of knowledge flow between university divisions and helps to identify the most intradependent, influential, and interdisciplinary areas of study. We discuss how course-prerequisite networks can be used by students, faculty, and administrators for detecting important courses, improving existing and creating new courses, navigating complex curricula, allocating teaching resources, increasing interdisciplinary interactions between departments, revamping curricula, and enhancing the overall students’ learning experience. The proposed methodology can be used for the analysis of any {CPN}, and it is illustrated with a network of courses taught at the California Institute of Technology. The network data analyzed in this paper is publicly available in the {GitHub} repository.},

	abstract = {This study examines how social media communication and brand image influence international students’ enrollment intentions in higher education institutions, particularly in response to China’s declining birth rate and increasing number of college graduates. Official data projects an “overcapacity” of over 2.79 million in mainland China’s universities by 2024, with an excess rate of 23.6\%. Strategies such as enhancing institutional standards and expanding international student enrollment are being considered to address these trends. Using data from 156 foreign students at three upgraded colleges in Guangxi, this paper explores the roles of user-generated and school-generated contents in social media communication, as well as brand image development factors. Partial least squares regression was employed to evaluate the measurement model and hypotheses. The analysis reveals that social media communication and brand image positively affect brand preference, with brand image mediating their relationship. Interactivity, transparency, and authenticity on social media platforms, along with academic reputation, internationalization, and cultural diversity, significantly influence enrollment intentions. This research offers practical guidance for universities aiming to enhance their brand image via social media to attract more international students, addressing demographic and institutional challenges.},

As a result, different ways to measure administrative process efficiency were found, such as formulated models, methods, and indicators that show quantitative benefits. A significant finding was Lean or Six Sigma practices to improve administrative efficiency, in addition to the consideration of the interest group opinion through the application of measurement instruments to measure the impact on the user satisfaction level.},

Using {PRISMA} principles and protocol, 138 articles were identified for a full examination. Using a priori, and grounded coding, the data from the 138 articles were extracted, analyzed, and coded. The findings of this study show that in 2021 and 2022, publications rose nearly two to three times the number of previous years. With this rapid rise in the number of {AIEd} {HE} publications, new trends have emerged. The findings show that research was conducted in six of the seven continents of the world. The trend has shifted from the {US} to China leading in the number of publications. Another new trend is in the researcher affiliation as prior studies showed a lack of researchers from departments of education. This has now changed to be the most dominant department. Undergraduate students were the most studied students at 72\%. Similar to the findings of other studies, language learning was the most common subject domain. This included writing, reading, and vocabulary acquisition. In examination of who the {AIEd} was intended for 72\% of the studies focused on students, 17\% instructors, and 11\% managers. In answering the overarching question of how {AIEd} was used in {HE}, grounded coding was used. Five usage codes emerged from the data: (1) Assessment/Evaluation, (2) Predicting, (3) {AI} Assistant, (4) Intelligent Tutoring System ({ITS}), and (5) Managing Student Learning. This systematic review revealed gaps in the literature to be used as a springboard for future researchers, including new tools, such as Chat {GPT}.},

	abstract = {The recent unexpected impact of the global pandemic on higher education has caused universities, governments, students, and teachers to reexamine all components of existing systems, including how to become more effective and efficient in using technologies for education. We have seen that moving classes online—either blended or fully online—can be done rapidly, but early reports show huge variations in quality, acceptance, completion, and learning. Thus, it is important to examine the existing research literature on pedagogical innovations and practices that use technologies. To understand this complex situation, the present study examines the current technological, organisational, and pedagogical trends and challenges using an exploratory design carried out in three stages. In stage one, a literature review of the academic and grey literature was conducted, identifying 14 trends of interest. These trends were used in a workshop and interview discussion between leading experts in the higher education field. Stage two focused on identifying 108 initiatives that represent these trends. Finally, 30 of these were selected as cases for further exploration in stage three. Using thematic analysis, the 30 cases were condensed into 12 main themes that represent the innovative practices that led to development of the {IDEAS} framework as a signpost on the roadmap of next-generation pedagogy for transforming higher education. {IDEAS} is presented in the discussion alongside examples and ways to apply it in higher education contexts.},

These data have considerable potential to bring digital technologies in education to a new level of personalized learning and data-driven management of the educational process. However, the way data are collected and stored in a typical university makes it difficult to achieve the mentioned goals, with limited examples of data being used for the purposes of learning analytics. In this work, based on the analysis of existing information systems and databases at Siberian Federal University, we propose principles of design for a university database architecture that allow for the development and implementation of a data-driven management approach. We consider various levels of detail of education data, describe the database organization and structure, and provide examples of learning analytics tools that can benefit from the proposed approach. Furthermore, we discuss various aspects of its implementation and associated questions.},

	abstract = {Introduction: This study develops a methodology for forecasting student demand at the Academic Unit of Engineering, Industry, and Construction of the Catholic University of Cuenca, addressing the challenge of short time series. Materials and methods: Daily enrollment data (22 observations/program) were used. To overcome data scarcity, data augmentation was applied by combining {SMOTE} interpolation with bootstrapping, expanding the sample. Four regression models were evaluated on this augmented data: linear, polynomial (2nd and 3rd degree), and logistic. The selection of the optimal model for each of the five programs was performed using a multi-criteria framework that integrates the Neutrosophical Analytic Hierarchy Process ({AHP})—to weight criteria such as R², {RMSE}, {MAPE}, and {MAE} under uncertainty—and the {TOPSIS} technique for the final ranking. Results: The data augmentation allowed the series to be expanded to approximately 55 observations. The {TOPSIS} analysis revealed that there was no single optimal model: the third-degree polynomial model was selected for Civil and Industrial Engineering; the second-degree model for Architecture and Electrical Engineering; and the linear model for Design. Discussion: The proposed methodology proves superior to the use of deep learning with limited data, avoiding overfitting. The combination of data augmentation and neutrosophic multi-criteria selection provides a robust, transparent, and adaptable framework that manages uncertainty and justifies model selection based on the specific dynamics of each program. Conclusions: This study validates that data augmentation and model selection using Neutrosophic {AHP}-{TOPSIS} constitute an effective and pedagogical tool for demand forecasting in data-constrained contexts, offering university management a tool for more precise and evidence-based academic and resource planning.},

	abstract = {Data in the educational context are becoming increasingly important in decision-making and teaching-learning processes. Similar to the industrial context, educational institutions are adopting data-processing technologies at all levels. To achieve representative results, the processes of extraction, transformation and uploading of educational data should be ubiquitous because, without useful data, either internal or external, it is difficult to perform a proper analysis and to obtain unbiased educational results. It should be noted that the source and type of data are heterogeneous and that the analytical processes can be so diverse that it opens up a practical problem of management and access to the data generated. At the same time, ensuring the privacy, identity, confidentiality and security of students and their data is a “sine qua non” condition for complying with the legal issues involved while achieving the required ethical premises. This work proposes a modular and scalable data system architecture that solves the complexity of data management and access. On the one hand, it allows educational institutions to collect any data generated in both the teaching-learning and management processes. On the other hand, it will enable external access to this data under appropriate privacy and security conditions.},

	abstract = {Abstract Student attrition poses a major challenge to academic institutions, funding bodies and students. With the rise of Big Data and predictive analytics, a growing body of work in higher education research has demonstrated the feasibility of predicting student dropout from readily available macro-level (e.g., socio-demographics or early performance metrics) and micro-level data (e.g., logins to learning management systems). Yet, the existing work has largely overlooked a critical meso-level element of student success known to drive retention: students’ experience at university and their social embeddedness within their cohort. In partnership with a mobile application that facilitates communication between students and universities, we collected both (1) institutional macro-level data and (2) behavioral micro and meso-level engagement data (e.g., the quantity and quality of interactions with university services and events as well as with other students) to predict dropout after the first semester. Analyzing the records of 50,095 students from four {US} universities and community colleges, we demonstrate that the combined macro and meso-level data can predict dropout with high levels of predictive performance (average {AUC} across linear and non-linear models = 78\%; max {AUC} = 88\%). Behavioral engagement variables representing students’ experience at university (e.g., network centrality, app engagement, event ratings) were found to add incremental predictive power beyond institutional variables (e.g., {GPA} or ethnicity). Finally, we highlight the generalizability of our results by showing that models trained on one university can predict retention at another university with reasonably high levels of predictive performance.},

	abstract = {This systematic literature review evaluates predictive models in education, focusing on their role in forecasting student performance, identifying at-risk students, and personalising learning experiences. The review compares the effectiveness of machine learning ({ML}) algorithms such as Support Vector Machines ({SVMs}), Artificial Neural Networks ({ANNs}), and Decision Trees with traditional statistical models, assessing their ability to manage complex educational data and improve decision-making. The search, conducted across databases including {ScienceDirect}, {IEEE} Xplore, {ACM} Digital Library, and Google Scholar, yielded 400 records. After screening and removing duplicates, 124 studies were included in the final review. The findings show that {ML} algorithms consistently outperform traditional models due to their capacity to handle large, non-linear datasets and continuously enhance predictive accuracy as new patterns emerge. These models effectively incorporate socio-economic, demographic, and academic data, making them valuable tools for improving student retention and performance. However, the review also identifies key challenges, including the risk of perpetuating biases present in historical data, issues of transparency, and the complexity of interpreting {AI}-driven decisions. In addition, reliance on varying data processing methods across studies reduces the generalisability of current models. Future research should focus on developing more transparent, interpretable, and equitable models while standardising data collection and incorporating non-traditional variables, such as cognitive and motivational factors. Ensuring transparency and ethical standards in handling student data is essential for fostering trust in {AI}-driven models.},

A total of 27 peer-reviewed studies published between 2013 and 2025 were analyzed. First, a general description of the selected works was provided, followed by a breakdown by dimensions in order to identify recurring patterns, stated interests and gaps in the current scientific literature on the use of {AI}-driven {APIs} in Education. The findings highlight five main benefits: data interoperability, personalized learning, automated feedback, real-time student monitoring, and predictive performance analytics. All studies addressed personalization, 74.1\% focused on platform integration, and 37\% examined automated feedback. Reported outcomes include improvements in engagement (63\%), comprehension (55.6\%), and academic achievement (48.1\%). However, the review also identifies concerns about privacy, algorithmic bias, and limited methodological rigor in existing research.
